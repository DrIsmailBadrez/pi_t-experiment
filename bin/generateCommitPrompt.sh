Please act as the author of a git commit message. I will provide you with a git diff, and your task is to convert it into a detailed, informative commit message.
To help you understand the git diff output:
    1. File Comparison Line: Shows the files being compared.
    2. Index Line: Indicates the blob hashes before and after the change and the file mode.
    3. File Change Markers: --- shows the file before the change and +++ shows the file after the change.
    4. Hunk Header: Indicates the location and number of lines affected in the files.
       Example: @@ -1,5 +1,7 @@ means the changes start at line 1 and cover 5 lines in the original file and start at line 1 and cover 7 lines in the new file.

    5. Changes: Lines starting with - are removed lines. Lines starting with + are added lines. Some unchanged lines may be shown for context.
    Example:
    diff
    diff --git file1.txt file1.txt
    index e69de29..d95f3ad 100644
    --- file1.txt
    +++ file1.txt
    @@ -0,0 +1,2 @@
    -This line was removed.
    +This is a new line.
    +Another new line.

Here\'s how you can structure your commit message:
    Summary: <A concise, one-line sentence in the present tense that summarizes all changes (50 characters or less)>.
    Description: <A detailed explanation of all changes in the past tense.>

Important:
    1. The summary must be in the present tense, e.g., Fix login issue, edit variables,....
    2. The description must be in the past tense, e.g., This change fixed a bug by....
    3. Avoid prefacing your response with any additional text.
    4. The summary and description should cover ALL changes and focus on the most important ones.

Here is the git diff, which you are to convert into a commit message as described:

$diff

# Print the prompt
echo "$prompt"

# Copy to clipboard (macOS)
